# Accessibility (A11Y) Considerations

This document outlines all accessibility improvements implemented in the application.  
Only items listed here should be used during marking.

---

## **1. Use of Accessible MUI Components**
All UI elements are built using Material UI components (e.g., `Button`, `TextField`, `Card`, `Rating`, `Dialog`, `Snackbar`).  
These components provide:

- Correct semantic roles
- Built-in keyboard accessibility
- Automatic ARIA attributes

Files using these: `Navbar.jsx`, `HostListings.jsx`, `Landing.jsx`, `ListingDetail.jsx`.

---

## **2. All Input Fields Have Explicit Labels**
Every form input uses a proper `<TextField label="...">`.  
This ensures screen-readers can identify the purpose of fields.

Examples:
- Login / Register forms (`AuthForm.jsx`, `Login.jsx`, `Register.jsx`)
- Listing creation and editing (`ListingForm.jsx`)

---

## **3. Alt Text for All Images**
Thumbnail images include meaningful `alt` text such as the listing title.  
This helps non-visual users understand image content.

---

## **4. Accessible Dialogs with ARIA Labels**
Confirmation dialogs for Delete / Publish / Unpublish include:

- `aria-labelledby`
- `aria-describedby`

This allows assistive technologies to announce dialog purpose clearly.

---

## **5. Snackbar Announcements for Errors and Success**
The global `Msgsnackbar` component uses MUI `<Alert>` with an implicit `role="alert"`.

Important status updates (login errors, delete success, publish/unpublish, booking actions) become perceivable for screen-reader users.

---

## **6. Full Keyboard Navigation Support**
Because the UI uses MUI elements:

- Users can tab through all inputs  
- Buttons activate with Enter/Space  
- Dialogs trap focus correctly  
- Forms submit via Enter

This ensures accessibility for keyboard-only users.

---

## **7. Guarded Routes Prevent Confusing States**
Protected pages such as Host Listings or Edit Listing redirect unauthenticated users.  
This avoids inaccessible UI states and supports predictable navigation.

---

## **8. Responsive Layout Improves Readability**
MUI responsive props such as:

```
flexDirection={{ xs: 'column', sm: 'row' }}
```

ensure layouts adapt to:

- 400px width (minimum marking requirement)
- Mobile screen readers
- Users who zoom text heavily

---

## **9. Clear Typography Hierarchy**
Consistent text hierarchy using MUI Typography:

- Page titles → `h4`
- Section titles → `h5`
- Body text kept readable

This helps users quickly interpret the structure.

---

# **Summary**

The application provides:

- Semantic and accessible components (MUI)
- Clear input labels
- ARIA-compliant dialogs
- Accessible error/success feedback
- Keyboard-navigable UI
- Screen-reader-friendly images
- Predictable & guarded navigation
- Responsive layouts

All of these contribute to a significantly more accessible user experience.
